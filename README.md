=====================

University of Nottingham Workshop - July 2014

## Set Up

Please ensure that you have the following software enabled before you arrive on the course.

- [R] (http://www.r-project.org/) version 3.0.2 (or later).

- [RStudio desktop IDE] (http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) version 0.97 (or later). This will provide an editor for writing code, or you can also use any other plain-text editor that you are familiar with.

- R package building requirements: on Linux and Mac, most requirements should be installed by default. Windows users will need [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). When installing Rtools, make sure to update your path accordingly. 
  Additional information regarding the installation of R and Rtools can be found [here] (https://github.com/DevasenaInupakutika/2014-07-10-Nottingham/blob/master/R%20SetUp.md).

- Windows users should install [Git bash](https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash) to get Git, bash, and make (among other Unix tools). Alternatively, these tools are also available via [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/).

- Mac and Linux users should ensure they have "git" and "make" on their system, and know how to access a terminal. Mac users can download git from http://git-scm.com/download/mac.

- (optional) A working LaTeX distribution. Linux users should use their package manager. Mac users can install [Mactex] (http://tug.org/mactex/). Windows users can install [Miktex](http://miktex.org/). While not strictly needed for the bootcamp, LaTeX is an important part of R package building and documentation.


## Lesson Plan

### Lesson 1: Unix Shell Scripting

Participants will be introduced to shell, command-line interface and its importance in Scientific computing for task automation.

### Lesson 2: R

Participants will be introduced to R basics and R programming using loops, writing functions and Data analysis using plotting and Visualisation.

### Lesson 3: : Version Control with git/GitHub

Participants will learn basic commands and workflows for the version control system git, as well as the process of collaborating on documents via GitHub.

### Lesson 4: Making R packages, Vignettes and Testing

Participants will learn generating their own R package by putting their functions and objects together, documenting their work, testing and hence making their research work reproducible.
